# Sentiment-analysis-on-Clothes-Reviews
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on clothing reviews.<br><br>
Given a set of reviews, the system is able to classify each review as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed in the text.<br><br>
The sentiment analysis is implemented using machine learning techniques and natural language processing techniques. The dataset used for training the model consists of thousands of reviews of clothing items collected from online shopping websites.<br><br>
The system is developed in Python and utilizes popular NLP libraries such as NLTK and scikit-learn. The project is open source and available on GitHub for anyone to use or contribute to. The results of the sentiment analysis can be used by clothing retailers to gain insights into customer satisfaction and make data-driven decisions.
